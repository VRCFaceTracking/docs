# Pico 4 Pro / Enterprise

## Introduction

The Pico 4 Pro / Enterprise is a standalone VR headset powered by the Qualcomm XR2, similar to the Quest 2 and Quest Pro headsets from Meta.
Unlike the "consumer" version of the Pico 4, the Pro and Enterprise versions of the headset have additional eye and face tracking cameras, in addition to a few more hardware upgrades. 
The Pro and Enterprise editions only differ in the available system software and region availability: the Pro only being sold in mainland China, while the Enterprise is sold in Europe with "limited" enterprise software.

##  Streaming Assistant Setup

:::tip
Both the Pro and Enterprise can use the updated PC streaming app "Pico Streaming Assistant" to stream eye and face tracking data from the headset. 
:::

1. Make sure your headset is on latest firmware version.
2. Enable both Eye Tracking and Lip Tracking on Pico Settings, those can be found under LAB tab.
3. Install [Streaming Assistant](https://www.picoxr.com/global/software/pico-link) on your computer.

##  Pico Connect (BETA) Setup

:::info
Pico Connect is currently not public available and requires access to the Beta files, only follow those steps if you do have access to Pico Connect.
:::

1. Make sure your headset is using at least using v5.9.0 firmware. 
2. Enable both Eye Tracking and Lip Tracking on Pico Settings, those can be found under LAB tab.
3. After installing Pico Connect on your computer you should update a hidden configuration to change it's facetracking to legacy protocol, find the file at `C:\Users\{YourUsername}\AppData\Roaming\PICO Connect\setting.json` and change `faceTrackingTransferProtocol` to `2`. This is a temporary fix, currently the module does not support the newer protocol.

## Module

Install the "Pico4SAFTExtTrackingModule" from the [VRCFaceTracking Module Registry](../vrcft-software/vrcft.mdx#module-registry).

[Pico4SAFTExtTrackingModule source repository](https://github.com/regzo2/PicoStreamingAssistantFTUDP/tree/vrcfacetracking-module)

### Startup Instructions

1. Start PCVR using the Pico Streaming Assistant 
2. Once connected and in SteamVR, start VRCFaceTracking with the Pico4SAFTExtTrackingModule initialized

:::warning
The Pico 4 Pro/Enterprise module will currently (erroneously) always initialize, and will fail to shutdown its own update thread when tearing down modules (closing VRCFaceTracking).
You may need to shut down VRCFaceTracking manually.
