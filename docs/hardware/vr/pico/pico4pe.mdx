# Pico 4 Pro / Enterprise

The Pico 4 Pro / Enterprise is a standalone VR headset powered by the Qualcomm XR2, similar to the Quest 2 and Quest Pro headsets from Meta.
Unlike the "consumer" version of the Pico 4, the Pro and Enterprise versions of the headset have additional eye and face tracking cameras, in addition to a few more hardware upgrades. 
The Pro and Enterprise editions only differ in the available system software and region availability: the Pro only being sold in mainland China, while the Enterprise is sold in Europe with "limited" enterprise software.

##  Pico Connect Setup

1. Make sure your headset is using at least using v5.9.0 firmware. 
2. Enable both Eye Tracking and Lip Tracking on Pico Settings, those can be found under LAB tab.
3. Verify that you have Pico Connect installed on your headset. If not, you will need to get it from the Pico Store first before continuing.
4. Install [Pico Connect](https://www.picoxr.com/global/software/pico-link) on your computer.
5. After installing Pico Connect on your computer you should update a hidden configuration to change its facetracking to legacy protocol, 
find the file at `C:\Users\{YourUsername}\AppData\Roaming\PICO Connect\setting.json` and change `faceTrackingTransferProtocol` to `2`. 
This is a temporary fix; currently the Pico4SAFTExtTrackingModule does not support the newer protocol.

##  Streaming Assistant Setup (Legacy)

:::tip
Streaming Assistant is only available for Headsets using firmaware older than 5.9.0. It is really recommend to update the firmware to latest version and use Pico Connect instead.
:::

1. Enable both Eye Tracking and Lip Tracking on Pico Settings, those can be found under the **LAB** tab.
2. Install [Streaming Assistant](https://www.picoxr.com/global/software/pico-link) on your computer.

## Module

Install the **"Pico4SAFTExtTrackingModule"** from the [VRCFaceTracking Module Registry](@site/docs/vrcft-software/vrcft.mdx#module-registry).

### Startup Instructions

1. Start PCVR using the Pico Connect or Pico Streaming Assistant 
2. Once connected and in SteamVR, start VRCFaceTracking with the Pico4SAFTExtTrackingModule initialized

:::warning
The Pico 4 Pro/Enterprise module will currently (erroneously) always initialize, and will fail to shutdown its own update thread when tearing down modules (closing VRCFaceTracking).
You may need to shut down VRCFaceTracking forcefully.
