# Pimax Super/Crystal

This guide will show you how to set up your Pimax Super/Crystal for VRCFaceTracking. 
Unlike other Pimax HMD's, the Pimax Super/Crystal requires a different setup.

:::note
This guide assumes you have [PimaxPlay](https://pimax.com/pages/downloads-manuals) installed alongside SteamVR.
If you do not have [PimaxPlay](https://pimax.com/pages/downloads-manuals)
installed, please install it before continuing.

### Requirements
- [PimaxPlay](https://pimax.com/pages/downloads-manuals)
- [BrokenEye](https://github.com/ghostiam/BrokenEye/releases)
- [SRanipal_**1.3.6.5**.zip](https://discord.com/channels/849300336128032789/915075185328152606/1017600042837753906)
- [VRCFTTobiiAdvanced Module](https://github.com/ghostiam/PimaxCrystalAdvanced/releases/latest)


## Set-up

### Installation
Create a folder on your desktop to store all of the files you will be downloading. This will make it easier to find them later.

### 1)  Install and configure [PimaxPlay](https://pimax.com/pages/downloads-manuals)
First, open PimaxPlay and go to the settings tab. Ensure that the eye tracking option is enabled in the device settings, and perform an eye-tracking calibration.

### 2) Install [BrokenEye](https://github.com/ghostiam/BrokenEye/releases)
Download the latest release and extract BrokenEye.exe into the folder you created.

### 3) Download [SRanipal_1.3.6.5.zip (Discord Link)](https://discord.com/channels/849300336128032789/915075185328152606/1017600042837753906)

:::note
While SRanipal v1.3.1.1 does work with BrokenEye, we strongly recommend using v1.3.6.5 as it has been shown to have more consistent and reliable eyelid tracking over v1.3.1.1 when used with the Crystal.
:::

Download SRanipal_1.3.6.5.zip from the VRCFaceTracking Discord Server in #file-share and extract the contents into the same folder as BrokenEye.exe. You do **NOT** need to run SRanipal. 

:::warning
Ensure that the contents are **NOT** in a sub-folder and are in the same directory as BrokenEye.exe
:::

:::note
Only the following files are necessary.
- ``EyePredictionModule.dll ``
- ``EyePredictionTVM.dll ``
- ``OpenCL.dll ``
- ``opencv_world310.dll ``
- ``tvm_runtime.dll ``
- ``model\EyePrediction\00-0000.params_opencl.dll ``
- ``model\EyePrediction\00-0000.params_opencl.json ``
- ``model\EyePrediction\00-0000.params_opencl.params ``

Unnecessary files can be safely deleted.
:::

### 4) Install the [VRCFTTobiiAdvanced Module](https://github.com/ghostiam/VRCFTTobiiAdvanced/releases)
Launch VRCFaceTracking, and from the Modules tab, click the "Install from package" button at the top, and select the VRCFT-Tobii-Advanced Module. Upon relaunch of the application, you should see a new module called "Tobii Advanced" being loaded.

### 5) All together now!
Now that you have all of the required software installed, it's time to put it all together. First, launch PimaxPlay and SteamVR. Once SteamVR is running, launch BrokenEye.exe. If the eye tracker is not automatically connected, click "**Connect to device**" Then, launch VRCFaceTracking. Done!


## Uninstalling The VRCFTTobiiAdvanced

To uninstall The VRCFTTobiiAdvanced, go to the Module Registry, select the VRCFT-Tobii-Advanced Module and click the uninstall button at the bottom.
