# Quest Pro

The Meta Quest Pro provides eye gaze tracking, detailed eye expression tracking, and face tracking.
All eye and face tracking hardware is internal to the device (no additional hardware setup required).
All eye and face tracking data is accessed via Meta’s Face and Eye OpenXR extensions.
There is currently no way for VRCFT to simultaneously extract data from the headset and send eye and face tracking to the Quest version of VRChat, so the following solutions are only for PCVR.
Previously, a beta version of the native VRChat Quest client included built in eye tracking support without the need for VRCFaceTracking. This version is discontinued and is no longer available.

:::danger
The Quest Pro has been shown to be *extremely* susceptable to sweat damage.
There have been a practically significant number of users who have experienced the exact same failure mode
of Eye-tracking not working after sweat ingress.
If you plan on exercising, dancing, or doing other sweat-inducing activities,
please take extra precautions against having sweat or other liquids reach the front part of the headset.
:::

## Why is this setup required?

The Quest Pro provides developers with both eye and face tracking data from a single, contained device, making it easy for native Quest developers to incorporate.
However, having it only accessible through Meta’s Oculus OpenXR extensions means there must be an OpenXR application using the Oculus runtime running somewhere.
Difficulty of the setup process depends on the desired PCVR connection method. 

---

## Setup

The basic Quest Pro setup flow:
1. [Enable Eye and Face Tracking on the Headset](#enable-eye-and-face-tracking-on-the-headset)
2. Set up desired PCVR connection method
3. Install corresponding VRCFT module

The Quest Pro currently has **5** readily available face-tracking compatible PCVR connection methods, listed in no particular order:

- [Oculus Link/Airlink](#oculus-linkairlink-setup)
- [ALXR](#alxr-setup)
- [ALVR](#alvr-setup)
- [Virtual Desktop](#virtual-desktop-setup)
- [SteamLink](#steamlink-setup)

Oculus Link/Airlink is Meta’s own PCVR streaming solution, and is generally straight-forward to set up (the PCVR part, not the face tracking part) and network stable, but also is limited in customization.
ALXR/ALVR are open-source projects and thus has many for features and customizability in the PCVR connection as compared to Airlink, but also may have more bugs, quirks, and generally may be harder to use.
Virtual Desktop is commonly seen as the "best" PCVR streaming solution, but it is not *free*, unlike all the other options.
SteamLink is Valve's (free) PCVR steaming solution meant specifically for using Quest headsets with SteamVR. 

If you need a recommendation for what to use for PCVR streaming:

- If you don't want to spend money and want to connect _wirelessly_: you should start with [**SteamLink**](#steamlink-setup) as it has the easiest and most straightfoward setup.
- If you don't mind spending money: you should use [**Virtual Desktop**](#virtual-desktop-setup) for ease of use and additional features.
- If you must use a wired (USB) connection: you should start with [**Oculus Link/Airlink**](#oculus-linkairlink-setup). 


With any option, the user is expected to have the VR PC and the Quest Pro on the same network, with the PC ideally connected to the network via ethernet cable (for wireless PCVR),
or Quest Pro connected to the PC with a high-quality USB 3.0+ cable (for "wired" PCVR, Virtual Desktop and SteamLink excluded).
You can learn more about improving your Quest PCVR streaming experience with the many guides available online.

### Enable Eye and Face Tracking on the Headset

1. Open up the Settings in your Quest Pro headset, and navigate to "Movement Settings"
2. Select the "Natural Facial Expressions" tab on the left, then Enable Natural Facial Expressions

1. [**MAKE SURE YOUR HEADSET HAS EYE AND FACE TRACKING ENABLED**](#enabling-eye-and-face-tracking-on-the-headset)
2. **CREATE DEVELOPER ACCOUNT AND ENABLE DEVELOPER MODE**: 

    1. [Set up a Meta Quest developer account](https://developer.oculus.com/sign-up/)
        * A developer account is still ***necessary*** as the eye and face over Link toggles are currently still in the developer settings of the Meta Quest Link PC application.
      It is rather trivial to apply for and there is no check for being a "real organization".
    2. Install the Meta Horizon (formerly "Oculus" and "Meta Quest") app on mobile device (if it isn’t already) and login with your (developer) Meta Quest account. Register your headset in the app.
    3. In the Meta Horizon mobile App, tap Menu at the bottom right, then Devices. Select your Quest Pro, then go to `Settings -> Developer Mode` and set the **Developer** Mode switch to enabled.
        * Reboot the headset after enabling Developer Mode.
        * This setting was formerly called "Developer Mode" in software versions before v60, became "Debug Mode" for a few cycles, and is now back again as "Developer Mode"

Switching to Virtual Desktop Beta (when a beta is active) may let you use yet-to-be-released features. 
In case there is a beta you would like to try, you can switch to the beta following the instructions in the dropdown

<details>
  <summary>How To Switch to Virtual Desktop Beta</summary>

  There are a few ways to change to Virtual Desktop Beta when a Beta is active. Meta constantly changes how to accomplish this so the fool-proof way is to just sideload the beta APK. 

  1. Change to the Beta channel on the Virtual Desktop Meta store page (while logged into your Meta Quest account). You will need to then update the Virtual Desktop app in your headset after this change. 
  <div style={{
    width: '75%',
    height: 'auto',

    display: 'block'
  }}>
    <img src={require("./img/quest/virtual_desktop_beta_desktop.png").default} alt="Changing to Beta on the Meta website" />
  </div>

  2. Change to the Beta channel in the Meta Quest phone app (while logged into your Meta Quest account). You will need to then update the Virtual Desktop app in your headset after this change.

  3. Install the beta APK manually. Grab the beta `VirtualDesktop.Android.Quest.apk` (without the 1) from the Virtual Desktop release page and [install it with SideQuest](#using-sidequest-to-side-load-quest-apps). You will need to uninstall the live version of Virtual Desktop from your Quest first.

## Tips and Tricks

### Using Sidequest to Side-load Quest Apps

1. Install SideQuest (Advanced Installer) on your computer. https://sidequestvr.com/setup-howto
   - The SideQuest application will have a built-in tutorial for the following steps.
2. Connect your Quest Pro headset to your computer with a *data-transfer* USB cable.
Once connected you will be prompted to "Allow USB debugging" and "Allow File Access". Make sure to allow both.
(You should also check the *Always allow from this computer* box to prevent the message from popping up again later)
3. Use SideQuest to install `alxr-client-quest.apk` to your Quest Pro. Click the *"Install APK file from folder"* button, then select the downloaded `alxr-client-quest.apk` in the file prompt.
<div style={{
  width: '90%',
  height: 'auto',
  margin: 'auto',
  display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/quest/hacks_sidequest-install-other-crop2.png").default} alt="How to install APKs in SideQuest" />
</div>
4. SideQuest should have a green notification bar show up at the bottom saying the operation was successful.

:::note
You may need to uninstall the previous version of the app you are trying to sideload if it exists and SideQuest fails the current app install.
:::

5. In your Apps Library, you will need to set the category of shown apps to "Unknown Sources" to see the sideloaded application.
You will need to tap the Search bar first before you see the category filter dropdown.

<div style={{
  width: '90%',
  height: 'auto',
  margin: 'auto',
  display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/quest/quest_pro_unknown_sources.png").default} alt="Quest Library Unknown Sources" />
</div>

### Aligning Play Spaces with SteamVR Lighthouse-tracked Devices

To use Vive trackers or other SteamVR Lighthouse tracked devices with the Quest Pro, you'll need to use **OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator**.
While the [original from pushrax](https://github.com/pushrax/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator) will work, many "Mixed VR" users have found the continous calibration forks
to be better, such as [bdunderscore's fork](https://github.com/bdunderscore/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator/tree/continuous-cal), or
[ArcticFox8515's fork](https://github.com/ArcticFox8515/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator) of bdunderscore's fork, or most recently **[Hekky's fork](https://github.com/hyblocker/OpenVR-SpaceCalibrator)**,
which comes with important performance fixes for continuous calibration.

We would recommend using ArcticFox8515's fork for now as it is the most recent and improves upon the original. 

### Using Index Controllers with the Quest Pro with Link/Airlink

Download these [Powershell Scripts (Discord Link)](https://discord.com/channels/849300336128032789/1033745772979699775/1056009844701806643)

To run, right-click the file -> `"Run with Powershell"`

These scripts will prevent Oculus Link from adding the Quest controllers to the SteamVR devices, allowing the use of Index controllers or any other controller of your choosing. 

You may have problems with running Powershell scripts downloaded from the internet (for good reason!). You can learn about [getting around Microsoft's default script security](https://adamtheautomator.com/run-powershell-script/).

### Using Index Controllers with the Quest Pro with Virtual Desktop

*Before* launching SteamVR from Virtual Desktop: 
In the Virtual Desktop "Streaming" tab, untick the "Track controllers" option under "Advanced Options" in the Streaming tab.
This will prevent Virtual Desktop from adding the Quest controllers to the SteamVR devices, allowing the use of Index controllers or any other controller of your choosing. 

<div style={{
  width: '66%',
  height: 'auto',
  margin: 'auto',
  display: 'block'
}}>
    <img src={require("./img/quest/virtual_desktop_track_controllers.png").default} alt="Virtual Desktop track controllers setting circled" />
</div>

### Using Index Controllers with the Quest Pro with ALVR/ALXR

The customizability of ALVR allows a few options in this regard. All following mentioned settings can be found in the "Headset" tab of the ALVR settings.

- Option 1: Completely disable the Quest Pro controllers using the checkbox next to "Controllers"
- Option 2: Set the Controller emulation to "HTC Vive Tracker". This allows real controllers such as the Index Controllers to take precedence in SteamVR, and allow
  for using the Quest Pro controllers for manual playspace calibration.

  <summary>[QuestProTrackingModule] Error: [QuestOpenXR] Failed to create session and I am NOT using a laptop / eGPU</summary>
  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="There is something preventing an OpenXR session from being created for the Quest Pro">
  
  <i>Carefully</i> re-run through <Link to="#oculus-linkairlink-setup">the setup</Link>, paying careful attention to all the steps.
  Doubly make sure that you have Oculus set as your OpenXR runtime in the Oculus Desktop app settings.
  <br/><br/>
  Make sure that your Quest Pro is *actively connected* (streaming content from PC and screens haven't gone to sleep) via Link/Airlink before starting VRCFT!
  Try starting VRCFT with the headset on, through the Oculus Dash desktop view.   </TroubleShootTable>

  <summary>[QuestProTrackingModule] Error: [QuestOpenXR] Failed to create session and I AM using a laptop / eGPU</summary>
  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="There is something preventing an OpenXR session from being created for the Quest Pro, possibly related to Oculus trying to default init on laptop's iGPU">
  
  Make sure that you have Oculus set as your OpenXR runtime in the Oculus Desktop app settings.
  Also make sure that your Quest Pro is actively connected via Link/Airlink before starting VRCFT.

  Try to turn off using integrated GPU through your laptop's BIOS or control center program.

  Alternatively, use Windows Settings to force VRCFaceTracking to "High Performance" (use discrete GPU).
  Open Windows Settings and navigate through System -> Display -> Graphics Settings (a small link under "Multiple Displays" section in Win10, or under "Related Settings" in Win11).

  <summary>[QuestProTrackingModule] Information: Eye Tracking not supported</summary>
  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="Developer (Debug) mode is not properly enabled.">
  
  On software versions v60, this error seems to be associated with the "Debug Mode" toggle not being enabled for the headset. 
  Use the Meta Quest phone app to enable Debug Mode for the Quest Pro headset, then reboot the headset. 
  If the issue persists or the module seems to initialize but doesn't send any data, try logging out then back into your Meta account on both
  the headset (via phone app) and PC Oculus application.

  <summary>[Virtual Desktop] Error: [VirtualDesktop] Failed to open MemoryMappedFile. Make sure Virtual Desktop Streamer (v1.29 or later) is running.</summary>
  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="VRCFaceTracking was started before Virtual Desktop">
  First, make sure both the Virtual Desktop app in the Quest and the Virtual Desktop streamer versions are at least v1.29.

  Close VRCFaceTracking, start Virtual Desktop Streamer, reopen VRCFaceTracking.

  If VRCFaceTracking is started before SteamVR/VRChat is launched from Virtual Desktop, the output log may show a warning that "Tracking is not active".
  However, after launching SteamVR/VRChat (*from Virtual Desktop*) the Virtual Desktop module should log that "Tracking is now active!".

### General Problems

<details>
  <summary>[Oculus Link/Airlink] VRCFT crashes or I get a "Failure to create instance" error</summary>
  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="Meta had broken their OpenXR runtime in the v67 and v68 updates, which causes module->VRCFT crashing (v68) or failure to create instance errors (v67).">
    Meta engineers are aware of the issue and have pushed a hotfix to the PTC. Try <a href="https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-rift-s/public-test-channel/">switching your Meta Quest Link PC software to the Public Test Channel</a> (68.0.0.474.361 or above) or updating to the latest version (v69 and above) if higher software versions have been released.</TroubleShootTable>
</details>

<details>
  <summary>[Oculus Link/Airlink] I cannot see SteamVR because Oculus is stuck loading some random app</summary>
  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="The nature of the way VRCFaceTracking must pull data from the Oculus OpenXR runtime from the PC is inherently hacky, effectively running 2 VR programs at once.">
    If you started SteamVR first, you can simply switch back to SteamVR in the Oculus Dash.
    You can also try switching up the program startup sequence, starting VRCFaceTracking then SteamVR through the desktop Steam app (not through the Oculus Dash in the headset).
    Yet another solution is to use <Link to="https://github.com/LibreQuest/OculusKiller">OculusKiller</Link> to avoid dealing with the Oculus Dash entirely, though this has its own downsides.

  <summary>[Oculus Link/Airlink] Starting VRCFT forces me out of VRChat and starts a program in SteamVR that never opens</summary>
  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="You have SteamVR set as the OpenXR runtime, which will cause the headless VRCFT module program to open in SteamVR instead of in the Meta Quest Link environment.">
    Set your OpenXR runtime to Meta Quest Link in the Meta Quest Link software.

  <summary>[Oculus Link/Airlink] "I'm <i>not getting any visible errors anywhere</i> and the Module loads, but VRC only receives 0 values for all parameters (and VRC loaded a non-zero number of parameters from config)"</summary>
  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="Meta Moment">
  Try toggling the eye and face tracking enables in the headset settings, and restarting your headset completely. 
  Logging out then back into the account in the PC Oculus application and headset may also help.
  You may also need to re-verify developer account settings if using Oculus Link/Airlink, as well as developer account permissions by logging into the <Link to="https://developer.oculus.com/">Meta Quest Developer Center</Link>.

  <summary>[SteamLink] VRCFaceTracking crashes when I set the SteamVR OSC output port to 9015!</summary>
  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="You changed one of VRCFaceTracking's communication ports to 9015">
  
  Revert VRCFaceTracking's ports back to the defaults (9000 sending/9001 receiving). 
  VRCFaceTracking uses these ports to communicate with VRChat and should not be changed. 
  Communication with the SteamVR OSC data happens in the SteamLink module on port 9015, and this is <b>handled internally by the module</b>, not the VRCFaceTracking base program!

  <summary>My playspace calibration resets if I take off the headset</summary>
  <TroubleShootTable
  cause="When the Quest headset enters sleep mode after detecting you have taken off the headset, it loses it's original reference space to which the SteamVR space was calibrated to.">
  Download the <Link to="https://developer.oculus.com/documentation/unity/ts-odh/">Meta Quest Developer Hub</Link> and follow the instructions for <i>Connect Headset to MQDH</i> and <i>Disable proximity sensor and guardian</i>.
  This will prevent the headset from entering sleep, but does mean your headset stays fully active even if you take it off.
  Alternatively, use another PCVR streaming method that supports Stage Tracking (Virtual Desktop, ALXR, ALVR, SteamLink).

Don't see your problem here? Think your problem might be unrelated to the module but something else? Take a look at the [VRCFT software page](../vrcft-software/vrcft.mdx) or search in the <TextColor color="#5763ee">#hardware-software-help</TextColor> forum in the <CustomLink to="discord"/>.

<!-- - **ALXR/ALVR methods: "[ERROR] No connection could be made because the target machine actively refused it"**
  - Cause: The ALXR VRCFT server is not running.
  - Solution: Usually the problem is related to [missing a step](#oculus-linkairlink-setup)
     and the ALXR log may make it clear as to what step exactly was forgotten. -->
