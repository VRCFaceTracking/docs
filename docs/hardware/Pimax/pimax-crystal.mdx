## Set-up

### Installation
Create a folder on your desktop to store all of the files you will be downloading. This will make it easier to find them later.

#### 1) Install and configure [PimaxPlay](https://pimax.com/download-pcvr-crystal/)
First, open PimaxPlay and go to the settings tab. Ensure that the eye tracking option is enabled in the device settings, and perform an eye-tracking calibration.

#### 2) Install and configure [EyeTrackVR Beta](https://github.com/EyeTrackVR/EyeTrackVR/releases)
Download the latest beta launcher and install it. Run the application to ensure it is working. If it is, close it and continue to the next step.

#### 3) Install and configure the [VRCFT-Tobii-Advanced Module](https://github.com/ghostiam/VRCFT-Tobii-Advanced/releases)
Launch VRCFaceTracking, and from the Modules tab, click the "Install from package" button at the top, and select the VRCFT-Tobii-Advanced Module. Upon relaunch of the application, you should see a new module called "Tobii Advanced" being loaded.

#### 4) Install and configure [BrokenEye](https://github.com/ghostiam/BrokenEye/releases)
Download the latest release and place it in your folder. Run this and follow the [instructions there](https://github.com/ghostiam/BrokenEye/blob/main/README.md).

#### 5) All together now!
Now that you have all of the required software installed, it's time to put it all together. First, launch PimaxPlay and SteamVR. Once SteamVR is running, launch BrokenEye followed by EyeTrackVR (Beta!). Then, launch VRCFaceTracking. If you see your eye preview in BrokenEye and  EyeTrackVR (Beta!), you're finished!

:::info
Some users have observed EyeTrackVR using a lot of their CPU. On newer Intel CPUs, this can be mitigated by disabling e-Cores in the BIOS. If you are unsure how to do this, please consult your motherboard's manual, or consult the internet.
