Follow this guide to setup your face-tracking hardware and start sending face tracking data to VRChat.

:::caution
Make sure your headset or hardware is supported first!
:::

## Overview

1. Download and install [VRCFaceTracking](../vrcft-software/vrcft.mdx)
2. Follow the setup instructions for your headset/hardware
3. Enable OSC In VRChat
4. Swap into a **VRCFT Compatible Avatar**

## Supported Hardware List

Click through the tabs to see all the different currently supported hardware!

## Detailed Setup guide

### 0️ Check Compatibility

If your headset or hardware isn't listed in the [Supported Hardware List](#supported-hardware-list) above, maybe consider adding support by creating a [VRCFT module](../vrcft-software/modules/modules.mdx)!

### 1️ Download and Install VRCFaceTracking

Download the AppInstaller for VRCFaceTracking below, or go to the [VRCFaceTracking program page](../vrcft-software/vrcft.mdx) to find alternative methods of installation.

<VRCFTInstallerCard/>

### 2️ Setup Hardware

Follow the link to the hardware page for your headset or face-tracking hardware in the [supported hardware table](#supported-hardware-list) above.
Every headset or hardware requires some kind of preparation to be used with VRCFaceTracking, whether that be a Quest Pro to an Android Phone, so **be sure to follow the setup instructions for the headset/hardware!**

#### Installing the VRCFaceTracking Module

Each hardware page should also direct you to the corresponding module(s) to use.
You can download the module directly from the VRCFaceTracking application.

<details>
  <summary>Example Module Installation</summary>

  1. Go to the Module Registry Tab in VRCFaceTracking
  2. Select the module you want to install (your headset/hardware page will list the available option(s))
  3. Click the "Install" button

  This example shows installation of the "QuestProOpenXRTrackingModule" for the Quest Pro headset.

    width: '90%',
    height: 'auto',
    margin: 'auto',
    display: 'block'
  }}>
    <img src={require("../vrcft-software/img/vrcft_module_registry_tutorial.png").default} alt="VRCFT Module Registry Page tutorial" />
  </div>

</details>

### 3️ Enable OSC In VRChat

To be able to use VRCFT, the OSC feature must be enabled in VRChat.
VRCFaceTracking will automatically set the game's OSC toggle setting to "Enabled" if it detects that it was not already, but you can (and should) enable it manually to avoid having to restart the game for the automatic switch to take effect.

<details>
  <summary>Don't know how to enable OSC?</summary>
  <div>
    <div>
      <ol>
        <li> Open the in-game radial menu </li>
        <li> Navigate through "Options" ➡️ "OSC" </li>
        <li> Ensure that the "OSC Enabled" option is toggled on (white box towards the right) </li>
      </ol>
    </div>
    <br/>
    <img
      src={require('./img/vrc_osc_menu.png').default}
      alt="VRChat OSC Menu with OSC Enabled"
      style={{margin: "auto", display: "flex"}}
    />
  </div>
</details>

### 4️ Test with a Public VRCFT Avatar

Visit some of the worlds listed in the pinned posts in the <TextColor color="#5763ee">#avatar-showoff</TextColor> channel in the <CustomLink to="discord"/> to try out a few face tracking avatars.
If you have eye tracking, you can also test the VRChat "native" eye tracking on almost any Av3.0 avatar.

<!-- apparently this part still isn't clear to some people -->
:::info Avatar Compatibility
At this time, VRChat does **not** have a native face tracking solution.
Avatars must have been specifically [set up](#avatar-setup) for face tracking to work with VRCFaceTracking.
**However, *most* VRChat Av3.0 Avatars should have basic eye tracking support as is.**
You can learn more about how [face tracking in VRChat](../facetracking101/breakdown.mdx) works if this is confusing.

## Avatar Setup

<!-- Oh yeah, this link can't be simply changed to an .mdx link because there is no .mdx, it's pointing to an autogenerated category..-->
If you have a working hardware and software setup, or only want to get started with setting up *avatars* for using with VRCFaceTracking, you should follow the [Avatar Setup Guide](../category/avatar-setup-guide)
