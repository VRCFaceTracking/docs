# Basic Avatar Setup

## Prerequisites

The first step to setting up your avatar with face tracking is to make sure that your face tracking works!

Make sure that you have followed [Getting Started](../../intro/getting-started.mdx) and have a working hardware and software setup before getting down to working on your own avatars. 
By doing this, you make your life when debugging your avatar *much* easier


## Model Implementation
:::info End Users
If you're an end user, you should continue on with the recommended setup process of adding a pre-made template using VRCFury, like [Adjerry's template*](https://github.com/Adjerry91/VRCFaceTracking-Templates/wiki/Face-Tracking-Template-Setup).
<small>*This is not software created by VRCFaceTracking and, therefore, we do not provide support or assistance using it.</small>

Before doing anything else, you'll need to create blendshapes for your avatar that map to [Unified Expressions](../tutorial-avatars-extras/unified-blendshapes). These allow for a consistent look across headsets, as well as implementing most features headsets support.
If you're editing a model, or this is your first time, [Hantnor](https://hantnor.com/) has made a video walking through her process:

<div class="row" style={{display: 'flex',  justifyContent:'center', alignItems:'center'}}>
    <ReactPlayer controls url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E2kx4kSoo8Y'/>
</div>



## Unity Implementation
Generally, using a template is the fastest way to make your blendshapes functional with VRCFaceTracking, but you're always welcome to implement it yourself in whatever way you want.

If you decide to implement it yourself a full list of parameters used by VRCFaceTracking is [here.](../tutorial-avatars-extras/parameters)

The most popular[^1] template available is one by Adjerry91. You can look through the wiki for it [here.](https://github.com/Adjerry91/VRCFaceTracking-Templates/wiki/Face-Tracking-Template-Setup)

## Done!
This is a very oversimplified guide, but it does lay out the general steps to follow, and should give you the stepping stones to follow for more information.
