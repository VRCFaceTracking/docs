### More Context!

***

Here is more context for you! There isn't really much else 
to explain, but if you wanted to add really detailed contexts 
to reference material here you can simply look at the source 
of this document!

Using an MDX snippet, we can import it as a component here, then 
using the `ContextModal` we can render this as a popup modal element 
on the website! Importing as MDX also retains the markdown thanks to 
how Docusaurus imports markdown as components.

If we make this long enough, we can actually have scrolling as an option too!
