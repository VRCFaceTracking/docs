### Lip Suck (generalized)

***

> The general term that represents how much the
> lip is trying to tuck into the mouth.

***

There are two distinct subgroups of Lip Suck shapes:

* Lip Suck (derived)
* Lip Suck Corner

Lip Suck (derived) is partially based on the lip muscles ability to tuck into the 
mouth, and at the extreme can represent other factors of the face such as a vacuum 
further pulling the lips inwards at extreme values.

Lip Suck Corner is *not* based on the Lip muscle group, but instead only 
represents an action that visibly modifies the lip corner being tucked laterally 
from a vacuum occuring in the mouth.

### Lip Suck (derived)

***

### Anatomy

Lip Suck is based on the complex 
[orbicularis oris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orbicularis_oris_muscle)'s 
action of pushing out and slightly pinching together the lips.

**Lip Suck** is part of 
the <ContextModal src={require('./_lip_general.mdx').default}><b>Lip</b></ContextModal> 
shape group. 

### Description

Lip Suck is an expression that pushes forward and slightly pinches together the lips. 

Unified Expressions splits this shape up into four (4) distinct shapes:

* LipSuckUpperRight
* LipSuckUpperLeft
* LipSuckLowerRight
* LipSuckLowerLeft

This allows interfaces and shapes to adopt more intricate shapes of the lips.

### Lip Suck Corner

***

### Anatomy

Lip Suck Corner is based on the results of the mouth forming a vacuum tucking the lip corners inwards.

**Lip Suck Corner** is part of 
the <ContextModal src={require('./_lip_general.mdx').default}><b>Lip</b></ContextModal> 
shape group. 

### Description

Lip Suck Corner is an expression that tucks the lips inwards slightly and together drastically.

This shape can be seen as a complement of 'Cheek Suck', in that they are both based on the same 
anatomical basis of the mouth forming a vacuum. *However*, the different is that 'Cheek Suck' *only* 
applies to the parts of the mouth *outside of the lips*, while Lip Suck Corner is completely mutually 
exclusive in how it can stay even when the mouth's vacuum ultimately dissipates, but *only* applies to 
the lips exclusively.
